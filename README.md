## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

In this challenge i got to work again with overlays, so i got to understand more about how they work and how to use them.

### Continued development

I had some problems with making this component responsive, so i think i still have a lot of work to do and a lot to learn about responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me for the responsive part of the challenge.
